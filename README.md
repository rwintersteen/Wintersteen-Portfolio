Welcome to my 'work-in-progress' professional portfolio! 
I am continuing to hone my CSS skills and work out the kinks. 
As of right now, my portfolio consists of a simple design showcasing my name boldly. I provided a few personal pictures to let the user get a breif view of my small but mighty family.
I included 2 blurbs that give the user some insight about me. Although my current work is small, I will continue to modify my portfolio as my skills get stronger.
I did not include my LinkedIn as its heavy with connections within dentistry, however as I get more comfortable showing off my skills, I will edit my portfolio as needed.

Thanks for taking a look at my README!
