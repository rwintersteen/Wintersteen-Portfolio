            <h1>My Story</h1>
                <p>Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, my hobbies are quintessentially Cascadian. I love being outdoors, but I find true joy when I'm birdwatching. 
                    Bowling is my first sport, however I have gained a real passion for the game of disc golf. And there's nothing quite like relaxing to reruns of Star Trek: TNG to an ice cold beer.<br>
                    I graduated from Portland State University in 2014 with my BS in General Sciences while working full time as a dental assistant.
                    Over the last decade, my career focus has been solely in dentistry and making my way through orthodontic assisting. 
                    Whether contributing my skills chairside with the dentist and orthodontist, or helping the front office with insurance and endless phone calls, I have filled just about every role in the dental clinic with my current credentials. <br>
                    I needed a fresh start and web development was my siren's call.</p>

                <p>I signed up for the University of Oregon's Coding Bootcamp in April 2021. Over the course so far, we've been honing our skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with more to learn. <br> Click on any of my projects to get a closer look at the work I have completed thus far in bootcamp!<br><br><br>
